# Melbourne Hack 2021 Computer Vision Workshop

Hey there! Welcome to the Melbourne Hack's 2021 Computer Vision Workshop! I hope you're as excited to learn about Computer Vision as I am about teaching it! By the end of this
workshop you will have a basic face mask detector that you can experiment and show off to your friends, and also a whole heap of **KNAWLIDGE** about Computer Vision and Image Processing, which will also hopefully encourage you to attempt some cool projects of your own! 

## Pre-Workshop Requirements

As mentioned in the notion link you probably came from, you'll need to install Python, which can be in either version 3.6/3.7/3.8/3.9 (any one of those work). Next, you'll need a face mask, please try to obtain a fairly plain styled one. 

Lastly, on your command line, you'll need to install the OpenCV Library for Python, as well as Google's MediaPipe Library.

You'll need to install them by running the following commands in the Command Line:

```python
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe 
```

And then you'll just need to clone this repository as a final step! And that pretty much covers it all! See you at the workshop!
